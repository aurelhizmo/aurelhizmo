Minority applicants tend to have significantly lower credit scores, higher leverage, and are less likely than White applicants to receive algorithmic approval from raceblind government-automated underwriting systems (AUS). Observable applicant-risk factors explain most of the racial disparities in lender denials. Further, we exploit the AUS data to show there are risk factors we do not directly observe, and our analysis indicates that these factors explain at least some of the residual 1-2 percentage point denial gaps. Overall, we find that differential treatment has played a more limited role in generating denial disparities in recent years than suggested by previous research.</span></p><br><p  dir="ltr" class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " style="margin-left: 0.0pt; padding-left: 0.0pt; text-indent: 0.0pt;"><span class="C9DxTc " style="font-family: Lato, Arial; font-weight: 700;">&quot;</span><a class="XqQF9c" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3422904" target="_blank" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"><span class="C9DxTc aw5Odc " style="text-decoration: underline;">Paying Too Much?

Survey data reveal that borrowers&#39; mortgage knowledge and shopping behavior strongly correlate with the rates they secure. We also document substantial variation in how expensive and profitable lenders are, without any evidence that expensive loans are associated with a better borrower experience. Despite many lenders operating in the US mortgage market, limited borrower sophistication may provide lenders with market power.</span></p><br><p  dir="ltr" class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " style=""><span class="C9DxTc " style="">&quot;</span><a class="XqQF9c" href="https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article/34/2/763/5827007" target="_blank" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"><span class="C9DxTc aw5Odc " style="text-decoration: underline;">Do Minorities Pay More for Mortgages?</span></a><span class="C9DxTc " style="">&quot; with Neil Bhutta.</span></p><ul class="n8H08c UVNKR " style="list-style-type: square; margin-left: 0; margin-right: 0; padding: 0;"><li  dir="ltr" class="zfr3Q TYR86d eD0Rn " style="margin-left: 45.0pt;"><p  dir="ltr" role="presentation" class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " style="margin-left: 0.0pt; padding-left: 0.0pt; text-indent: 0.0pt;"><span class="C9DxTc " style="font-family: Lato, Arial; font-weight: 700;"> The Review of Financial Studies, 2021</span></p></li></ul><p  dir="ltr" class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " style="margin-left: 0.0pt; padding-left: 0.0pt; text-indent: 0.0pt;"><span class="C9DxTc " style="font-style: italic;">Abstract:</span><span class="C9DxTc " style=""> We test for racial discrimination in the prices charged by mortgage lenders.

Using the NLSY79, our results suggest that ability is observed nearly perfectly for college graduates, but is revealed to the labor market more gradually for high school graduates. Consequently, from the beginning of their careers, college graduates are paid in accordance with their own ability, while the wages of high school graduates are initially unrelated to their own ability. This view of ability revelation in the labor market has considerable power in explaining racial differences in wages, education, and returns to ability.</span></p><br><p  dir="ltr" class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " style=""><span class="C9DxTc " style="font-family: Lato, Arial; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-weight: 700; vertical-align: baseline;">Working Papers and Projects</span></p><br><p  dir="ltr" class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " style=""><span class="C9DxTc " style="">&quot;</span><a class="XqQF9c" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3902308" target="_blank" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"><span class="C9DxTc aw5Odc " style="text-decoration: underline;">How Resilient is Mortgage Credit Supply?

Although the mortgage market experienced a historic boom in 2020, we show there was also a large and sustained increase in intermediation markups that limited the pass-through of low rates to borrowers. Markups typically rise during periods of peak demand, but this historical relationship explains only part of the large increase during the pandemic. We present evidence that pandemic-related labor market frictions and operational bottlenecks contributed to unusually inelastic credit supply, and that technology-based lenders, likely less constrained by these frictions, gained market share. Rising forbearance and default risk did not significantly affect rates on &quot;plain-vanilla&quot; conforming mortgages, but it did lead to higher spreads on mortgages without government guarantees and loans to the riskiest borrowers. Mortgage-backed securities purchases by the Federal Reserve also supported the flow of credit in the conforming segment.</span></p><br><p  dir="ltr" class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " style="margin-left: 0.0pt; padding-left: 0.0pt; text-indent: 0.0pt;"><span class="C9DxTc " style="font-variant: normal;">&quot;</span><a class="XqQF9c" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3902308" target="_blank" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"><span class="C9DxTc aw5Odc " style="font-variant: normal; text-decoration: underline;">Strictness and Disparate Impact: Why do Lenders Reject Loans with Government Guarantees?</span></a><span class="C9DxTc " style="font-variant: normal;">&quot; with Neil Bhutta, Daniel Ringo and Eileen van Straelen, 2024.

This paper develops a micro-founded equilibrium model that transparently shows how this local uninsurable risk affects individual location decisions and portfolio choices, and ultimately how it affects prices in equilibrium. I estimate a version of this model using house price and wage data and provide estimates for risk premia for different cities, which imply that homes are on average about $20000 cheaper than they would be if owners were risk-neutral. This estimate is over $100000 for volatile coastal cities. Creating assets that hedge city-specific risks increases house prices by about 20% and productivity by about 10%. The average willingness to pay for completing the market per homeowner is between $10000 and $20000. Welfare gains come both from better risk-sharing and from more efficient sorting of households across cities.</span></p><br><p  dir="ltr" class="zfr3Q CDt4Ke " style="margin-left: 0.0pt; padding-left: 0.0pt; text-indent: 0.0pt;"><span class="C9DxTc " style="">&quot;</span><a class="XqQF9c" href="https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2296" target="_blank" style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none;"><span class="C9DxTc aw5Odc " style="text-decoration: underline;">The Effects of the Ability-to-Repay / Qualified Mortgage Rule on Mortgage Lending</span></a><span class="C9DxTc " style="">&quot;, with Shane Sherlund.
